`<SmartInput />` is the best text input element for React because it's so easy to use and style, and for advanced users it provides rich analytics about end usage.

## Themes
Theming with JSX attributes is super simple: `<SmartInput theme="Material" />`, for example, restyles the input to the "Material" theme (defined in `themes.css`). You can also override styles or CSS classes like you would with any React component.

## Analytics
`<SmartInput />` captures and reveals rich insights and analytics in real-time, and maintains a detailed history of what's been entered and submitted in the past. Other details like time spent filling out a form, typing speed, keystrokes, backspaces, and more are also exposed. You can also configure a `<SmartInput />` to report keyword entries or emails entered to a specified API endpoint - like your favorite analytics software, or your application backend. Use `<SmartInput profile="Standard" />` to track according to the `StandardProfile` (defined in `/profiles`).
